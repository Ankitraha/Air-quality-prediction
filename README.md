# Pollutant-concentration-prediction
In this project, I have built a prediction model for pollutant concentration using the given dataset. The dataset contains information about the unique ID, indicator ID, name, measure, measure info, geographic type name, geographic join ID, geographic place name, time period, start date, data value, and message.

The model is designed to predict the conecntartion of pollutants based on the other available features in the dataset.The project includes detailed documentation and code for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and model deployment. The project can be useful for anyone who wants to learn about building a prediction model for pollutant data value using machine learning.
